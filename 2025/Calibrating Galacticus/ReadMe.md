Parameter files for all models run for this paper are available in the [CalibratingGalacticus-Paper1](https://github.com/Andrew-Robertson/CalibratingGalacticus-Paper1) repo, and are also mirrored here in the [`parameters`]() folder.

That repo contains full information on how to run these models, along with plotting scripts and links to the models themselves.
